- Top = highest priority
- Order in Backlog section = priority
- Reprioritize by moving lines up/down

ID FORMAT
- Sequential, fixed width: i0001
- ID is permanent and never changes
- Title is mutable
- Never reuse IDs
- next-id above is authoritative

CREATING A NEW ITEM
1. Use the value in <!-- next-id -->
2. Add the new line at the bottom of the Backlog section

COMMIT MESSAGES

OPENSPEC MAPPING
- backlog.sh plan i0001 creates openspec change i0001-short-slug

ARCHIVING ITEMS
- Move done items to Archive
