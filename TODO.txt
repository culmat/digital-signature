SIGNATURE DISPLAY & UX:
- optimize for many signatures. Sort by last signed, newest first, paginate and only show latest 10. Load more on user request
- implement visibilityLimit feature (collapse signed/missing signatures when count exceeds limit with "Show all" button)
- display user's full name instead of accountId (fetch via /wiki/api/v2/users-bulk API)
- implement "panel" mode toggle (styled panel vs plain display)
- https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/internationalization/
- carefully review wording. check for usability, avoid technical terms like "panel"

MACRO CONFIGURATION:
- implement macro config UI with parameters: 
  -- title ✅
  -- content ✅ 👍
  -- signers ✅ 👍
  -- signerGroups ✅ 👍
  -- inheritViewers ✅ 👍
  -- inheritEditors ✅ 👍
  -- maxSignatures ✅ 👍
  -- visibilityLimit ✅ 👍
  -- notified ❌ not possible in forge. Maybe add page property alerts later 
  -- panel ❌ (won't do)
  -- protectedContent ❌ (won't do)
  -- signaturesVisible : always, if user is allowd to sign, if user has signed ✅ 👍
  -- pendingVisible : always, if user is allowd to sign, if user has signed ✅ 👍
✅ 👍 support "petition mode" (no restrictions = any logged-in user can sign, with UI warning)
- support inheritSigners from page permissions (READERS_ONLY, WRITERS_ONLY, READERS_AND_WRITERS, NONE)
✅ 👍 implement maxSignatures limit (prevent further signatures when reached, support 0 to disable signing)
- implement visibility controls: signaturesVisible and pendingVisible (ALWAYS, IF_SIGNATORY, IF_SIGNED)

NOTIFICATIONS & EMAIL:
- implement notified users list (notify specified users when document is signed)
- send in-app notifications when signature added
- send email notifications when signature added
- implement mailto links for signed/missing users with fallback to emails page when URL too long
- create /emails endpoint to display email addresses of signed/unsigned users

EXPORT & SHARING:
- implement /export endpoint to generate printable HTML with all signatures and timestamps
- create PDF export functionality with all signatures

PROTECTED CONTENT:
- implement protectedContent feature (create protected child page visible only to signers)
- auto-grant VIEW permission to child page when user signs
- use signature hash as protected page key

LIFECYCLE & CLEANUP:
✅ 👍 implement event listener for page deletion

ADMIN UI & BACKUP/RESTORE:
✅  specification completed: docs/backup-restore-spec.md
- implement confluence:globalSettings module in manifest.yml
- create admin UI: src/frontend/admin.jsx (storage statistics, backup/restore controls)
- implement admin authorization check: src/utils/adminAuth.js
- implement backup manager: src/storage/backupManager.js (JSONL.gz export/import with streaming)
- implement admin data resolver: src/resolvers/adminDataResolver.js (GET/PUT /admin/data)
- add route to src/resolvers/index.js
- test with large datasets (1000+ entities)
- integrate cleanup UI into admin page

MISSING SIGNATURES TRACKING:
✅ 👍 track and display missing signatures (users who haven't signed yet) - Phase 1: Named signers only
- sync missing signatures list when macro config changes (add/remove users)
- support petition mode where missing list shows "*" for any user
- Phase 2: Add group resolution for pending calculation
- Phase 3: Add page permission inheritance for pending calculation

MIGRATION (see backup/restore spec for foundation)
- write separate migration specification (builds on docs/backup-restore-spec.md)
- define common format (use JSONL.gz as specified in backup-restore-spec.md)
- implement export from legacy macro
- implement import into forge macro (using PUT /admin/data endpoint)
