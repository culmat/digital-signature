- optimize for many signatures. Sort by last signed, newest first, paginate and only show latest 10. Load more on user request
- introduce seperate rendering for export with all signatures instead of pagination
- implement event listener for page deletion
- implement admin ui that shows number of signatures that can be cleaned up with storage space estimation and possibility to trigger cleanup
